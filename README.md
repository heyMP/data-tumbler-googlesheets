# Word Tumbler for Google Sheets

This is a simple randomizer that works with Google Sheets as the data source. It will randomly select and display one item from each column. This is useful if you need to quickly tumble random combinations of your own data. To load data, use a public Google Sheet url with 'CSV' set as the output format. The UI will load all columns and use the first row as labels.

To change the default URL, update the `DEFAULT_SHEET_URL` value in `index.html`.

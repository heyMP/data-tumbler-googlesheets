# Word Tumbler for Google Sheets

This is a simple randomizer for Google Sheets. It will randomly select and display one item from each column. This is useful if you need to quickly tumble random combinations of your own data. In `index.html`, you can specify a default public Google Sheet url with 'CSV' set as the output format.

The UI will load all columns and use the first row as labels.

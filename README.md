# Word Tumbler for Google Sheets

This is a simple randomizer for Google Sheets. You can specify a default Google Sheet URL with CSV set as the export format in `index.html`. Make sure to publish the Google Sheet publically and copy the CSV export link.

You can also load different urls using the input field. It will auto load the columns and use the first row as labels.
